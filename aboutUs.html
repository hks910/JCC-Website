These events have helped promote local businesses, foster international collaborations, and stimulate economic growth.
          
        JCC's scope is not limited to business and politics. We've also been a vibrant hub for cultural events, including indoor sports competitions and musical concerts, playing a key role in enriching the cultural fabric of Jakarta.</p>
